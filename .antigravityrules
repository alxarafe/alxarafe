# Alxarafe AI Behavior and Project Structure Rules

## Language & Coding Standards

- **Documentation Workflow**:
    - `doc/es/`: Primary source for documentation in Spanish.
    - `doc/en/`: Translation of `doc/es/`. The assistant is responsible for maintaining the English version in sync with the Spanish one.
    - Reference workflow: `.agents/workflows/sync-docs.md`.
